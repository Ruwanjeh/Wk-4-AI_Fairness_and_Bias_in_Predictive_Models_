# AI in Software Engineering Assignment

This project contains the solutions for the "AI in Software Engineering" assignment. It covers theoretical analysis, practical implementation of AI tools, and ethical considerations.

## Project Structure

-   `assignment_report.md`: Contains the answers to the theoretical questions (Part 1), ethical reflection (Part 3), and the bonus task.
-   `ai_code_completion.py`: Solution for Part 2, Task 1 - AI-Powered Code Completion.
-   `selenium_login_test.py`: Solution for Part 2, Task 2 - Automated Testing with AI.
-   `resource_allocation_predictive_analytics.ipynb`: Solution for Part 2, Task 3 - Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation.
-   `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository or download the project files.
2.  Open a terminal in the project directory.
3.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib selenium jupyter
    ```

    If you have issues with `pip`, you can try:
    ```bash
    python -m pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib selenium jupyter
    ```

## How to Run the Tasks

### Part 2, Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion

To run the code completion comparison script:

```bash
python ai_code_completion.py
```

### Part 2, Task 2: Automated Testing with AI (Selenium)

To run the automated login test:

```bash
python selenium_login_test.py
```

**Note:** This script requires Google Chrome and the corresponding ChromeDriver to be installed and in your system's PATH.

### Part 2, Task 3: Predictive Analytics

To view the predictive analytics notebook:

1.  Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

2.  Open the `resource_allocation_predictive_analytics.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface and run the cells.

## Theoretical Analysis and Ethical Reflection

For the answers to the theoretical questions, the case study analysis, the ethical reflection, and the bonus task, please refer to the `assignment_report.md` file.
